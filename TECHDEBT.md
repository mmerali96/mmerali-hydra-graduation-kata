# Techdebt

- ✅ TD1: Remove boilerplate code
- TD2: Refactor hard coded gameboard size values to be a single constant
- TD3: Refactor getGameboard to be more abstract so it can be used to print the bombBoard as well
- TD4: Refactor postionOffset in calculateNeighboringBombs to be a global constant
- ✅ TD5: Seed Bombs is hardcoded. Refactor it to be random but also take in a seed value to get a deterministic gameboard
