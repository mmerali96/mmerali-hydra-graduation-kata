  - âœ… Create testcase for MineField object
  - âœ… Create MineField class
  - âš  Represent gameboard in MineField class as a 2d array
  - âš  Create a function to print current contents of gameboard

# Pomodoro 2 610pm - 635pm

- âœ… Move backlog from readme.md to backlog.md
- âœ… Gather examples from backlog
- âœ… refactor backlog based on examples

# Pomodoro 3 640PM - 705PM

- ðŸš§ US1
  - âœ… Represent gameboard in MineField class as a 2d array
  - âœ… Create a function to print current contents of gameboard
  - âœ… Create helper function that prints board to console using getGameboard

# Pomodoro 4 710PM - 735PM

- âœ… US1
  - âœ… Create the startGame function that prints the empty gameboard with the message `[Sandbox 3x3] Game created`
- ðŸš§ US2
  - âœ… Create internal gameboard that holds a map of where the bombs are
  - ðŸš§ Initialize the internal map of bombs randomly when gameStart is called

# Pomodoro 5: 1/2/2024 1115PM - 1140PM

- ðŸš§ US2
  - âœ… Create test for seed bombs which will add 3 bombs to the internal map
  - âœ… Initialize the internal map of bombs randomly when gameStart is called
  - ðŸš§ Create a test for generating random starting location
  - ðŸš§ Create a function for generating random starting location

# Pomodoro 6: 1/2/2024 1145PM - 1210PM

- ðŸš§ US2
  - âœ… Create a test for generating random starting location
  - âœ… Create a function for generating random starting location
  - âœ… TD1: Remove boilerplate code
  - âœ… Call getStartingLocation in game driver
  - âœ… Create a test for function handleStepOnSquare
  - âš  Create a function that accepts a index and handles moving on that board spaced

# Pomodoro 7: 1/2/2024 1215PM - 1240PM

- ðŸš§ US2
  - âœ… Create a function that accepts a index and handles moving on that board spaced
  - âœ… handleStepOnSquare should return true if the space is a bomb and false otherwise
  - ðŸš§ calculateNeighboringBombs function should look at all the neighbors of a square and return the number that are bombs
    - âœ… define calculateNeighboringBombs
    - ðŸš§ calculateNeighboringBombs should take in 2 indices
    - ðŸš§ define directions that is a list offsets that can be added to indices to represent moving up, down, and diagonal
    - ðŸš§ calculateNeighboringBombs should return the number of bombs around a square
  - âš  handleStepOnSquare should mark the current square with the number of bombs around it if square is a clean square
- âœ… SONAR: fix security hotspot from sonarqube on math.random

# Pomodoro 8: 1/2/2024 1245PM - 110PM

- âœ… US2
  - âœ… calculateNeighboringBombs function should look at all the neighbors of a square and return the number that are bombs
    - âœ… calculateNeighboringBombs should take in 2 indices
    - âœ… define directions that is a list offsets that can be added to indices to represent moving up, down, and diagonal
    - âœ… calculateNeighboringBombs should return the number of bombs around a square
  - âœ… handleStepOnSquare should mark the current square with the number of bombs around it if square is a clean square
  - âœ… TD5: Seed Bombs is hardcoded. Refactor it to be random but also take in a seed value to get a deterministic gameboard

- âš  TODO
- ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
